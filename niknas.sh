• Alloys
	◦ 2 or more different elements
	◦ mixing together two different metals
	◦ different sized atoms
	◦ much harder than pure metal l
	◦ disrupts the regular structure
• Ions
	◦ charged particle
	◦ single or group of atoms
	◦ ion are made when atoms gain or lose electrons
	◦ full outer shell = 0 or 8
	◦ electrons are negatively charged
• Covalent Bonds
	◦ oppositely charged ions
	◦ attracted by electrostatic forces
	◦ sharing electrons
	◦ dot and cross diagrams
